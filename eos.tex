\section{Introduction}

Hydrodynamic simulations are a popular tool to model the spacetime evolution of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.
Lattice regularization is the only reliable method to calculate the QCD equation of state equation of state in the vicinity of a phase transition and hence 
constitutes a critical component of modern computer simulations. While lattice techniques are rigorous in their treatment of the underlying QCD Lagrangian, 
they are subject to numerical errors inherent in the lattice discretization procedure. These errors are manifest in differences in the continuum extrapolated QCD 
trace anomaly predicted by different lattice collaborations and lead to an overall uncertainty in the true value of the QCD equation of state at zero baryochemical 
potential.

For the purposes of hydrodynamic simulations, the equation of state is typically treated as a theoretically constrained quantity in contrast to e.g. the
QGP specific shear viscosity $\eta/s$ which is varied and tuned to optimally replicate experimental data. Consequently, numerical discrepancies between different 
lattice collaborations introduce an inherent systematic bias in the best fit values of underconstrained QGP properties determined from systematic model-to-data comparison. 
A notable exception to this convention is a recent model-to-data analysis which parameterized the QGP equation of state and used a Bayesian, data driven approach 
to constrain its functional form \cite{Novak:2013bqa}. 

Uncertainties in the equation of state have been studied both at low temperature, by comparing lattice predictions to results from a hadron resonance gas model
\cite{Huovinen:2009yb}, and at high temperature by comparing hydrodynamic predictions obtained using different parameterizations of the QCD trace anomaly 
\cite{Huovinen:2005gy, Huovinen:2009yb}. Large differences in the flows and spectra were observed when switching from a bag model equation of state with a first-order 
phase transition to a lattice equation of state exhibiting a smooth crossover, but only mild variations were observed when switching between different lattice 
parameterizations with a smooth crossover \cite{Huovinen:2009yb}.

Recent calculations by the HotQCD and Wuppertal-Budapest collaborations of the QCD trace anomaly in the continuum limit now show good agreement within errors. This signals an important
convergence in lattice descriptions of the QCD equation of state which previously exhibited a tension in the peak of the trace anomaly near the QGP phase transition. It is not yet clear however, if current
lattice errors are under sufficient control for hydrodynamic transport models or if further improvement is needed.  

In this work, we analyze the current status of lattice gauge calculations in the continuum limit by comparing simulation predictions using different lattice calculations for the QGP equation of state.
We study the latest HotQCD and Wuppertal-Budapest parametrizations as well as the depreciated s95 parametrization based on older HotQCD lattice results. 

We embed each equation of state in an event-by-event hydrodynamic model with a hadronic afterburner and measure spectra, flows and Bertsch-Pratt radii predicted by the simulations to quantify systematic 
differences between the calculations. We also assess the uncertainty introduced by continuum extrapolation when constructing the best fit parametrization by sampling splines from the bootstrap coefficients 
used in the HotQCD error analysis. Using these results, we comment on the resolving power of hydrodynamic simulations and assess the need for improved lattice calculations at zero baryo-chemical potential.

\section{Equations of State}

We consider three parameterizations for the QGP equations of state, the state of the art HotQCD and Wuppertal-Budapest parameterizations \cite{?} as well as the older s95-v1 parametrization based on 
older HotQCD results. For the purposes of this study, we focus on the intermediate and high temperature dependence of the lattice equation of state and assume that at lower temperatures, the dependence of the 
QCD equation of state is described by the hadron 
resonance gas model, which is to good approximation

\section{Initial Conditions}

We generate hydrodyamic initial conditions using a standard two-component Monte Carlo Glauber model which deposits entropy proportional to a linear combination of nucleon participants and binary nucleon-nucleon collisions,
\begin{equation}
 dS/dy \,\vert_{y=0} \propto \frac{(1-\alpha)}{2}N_\text{part} + \alpha N_\text{coll}.
\end{equation}

The entropy is localized about each nucleon's transverse parton density $T_p({\bf x})$,
\begin{eqnarray}
 dS/dy \,\vert_{y=0} &\propto& \sum\limits_{i=0}^{N_\text{part,A}} w_i\, T_p({\bf x} - {\bf x}_i)(1-\alpha + \alpha\, N_\text{coll,i}) \nonumber \\
                     &+& \sum\limits_{j=0}^{N_\text{part,B}} w_j\, T_p({\bf x} - {\bf x}_i)(1-\alpha + \alpha\, N_\text{coll,j}),
 \label{twocomponent}
\end{eqnarray}
where the summations run over the participants in each nucleus, $N_\text{coll,i}$ denotes the number of binary collisions suffered by the $i^\text{th}$ nucleon and the proton density $T_p({\bf x})$ is 
described by a Gaussian
\begin{equation}
 T_p({\bf x}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi B}} \exp \left(-\frac{x^2+y^2}{2 B} \right)
\end{equation}
with transverse area $B = 0.36$ $\text{fm}^2$.

The random nucleon weights $w_i$ in equation \eqref{twocomponent} are sampled independently from a Gamma distribution with unit mean
\begin{equation}
 P_k(w) = \frac{k^k}{\Gamma(k)} w^{k-1} e^{-k w},
\end{equation}
and shape parameter $k = \text{Var}(P)^{-1}$ which modulates the variance of the distribution. These fluctuations are typically added \cite{?} to reproduce the large multiplicity fluctuations observed in minimum bias proton-proton 
collisions. In this work the shape parameter is fixed to $k=1$ to fit the $200$ GeV UA5 data \cite{?}. 

It is important to note that the aforementioned Monte Carlo Glauber model is not a state of the art model for initializing hydrodynamic simulations. It makes many simplifying assumptions such as ignoring pre-equillibrium dynamics
and asserting wounded nucleon and binary collision scaling, an assertion which is questioned by a number of recent works. Nevertheless, the model provides a good description of observed particle multiplicities, flows and spectra. In this work, we 
are primarily interested in the \emph{sensitivity} of hydrodynamic observables to differences in the QGP equation of state and \emph{not} the overall best fit of model to data. Hence, the Monte Carlo Glauber model serves as suitable 
surrogate for more accurate physical models.

\section{Hydrodyamics and \\ Boltzmann Transport}

The initial condition profiles, which provide the entropy density $dS/(d^2r_\perp\, d\eta\, \tau_\text{therm})$ at the QGP thermalization time, are then used to initialize the boost invariant viscous hydrodynamics code 
{\ttfamily VISH2+1} \cite{?}.
